## Hybrid InceptionTime

The main core of the InceptionTime architecture is coming from another GitHub: https://github.com/TheMrGhostman/InceptionTime-Pytorch/blob/master/inception.py
It includes the InceptionTime architecture from this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04939 and rewritten in Pytorch instead of Keras.
A parameter for the hybrid case is added to the architecture.

The end of the code is the new part including the hybrid architecture in Pytorch instead of Kears.
According to this paper: https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020496 and the associated GitHub that defines the hybrid layer in Keras.
